# My personal website

This is the repo of my personal website (October 2024 redesign). The site is static, hosted on GitHub pages, and is built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and Svelte 5.


## Developing

Install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

Start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

Build the website with:

```bash
npm run build
```

Which can be previewed with:

```bash
npm run preview
```
