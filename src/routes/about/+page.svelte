<h1>About me</h1>

<p>
	I'm an astronomer and science communicator from the UK. Since completing my undergraduate degree
	in Bath in the UK in 2019, my career has taken me across Europe - doing my PhD in Heidelberg,
	Germany, and since 2025 working as a postdoc at the University of Vienna in Austria.
</p>

<p>
	I've always thought that effectively communicating science is as important as doing science
	itself. Throughout my PhD, I built a small online following by communicating my science on
	Twitter. When Twitter was effectively ruined for outreach, I turned my attention to building a new
	astronomy community on Bluesky. <a href="https://astrosky.eco/">The Astrosky Ecosystem</a> now includes
	over two thousand astronomers and astronomy organizations, and is working towards becoming a permanent
	home for astronomy outreach and communication online.
</p>

<p>
	I am also fiercely passionate about improving inclusivity & equality in science for all. To quote
	the charity Pride in STEM, “Science does not happen in a vacuum.” The environment in which we
	conduct research can have a profound effect on the wellbeing of minority groups. It is essential
	that science is a welcoming place, so that all minds can flourish and achieve their best.

<p>
	Outside of astronomy, I'm also a sound engineer, guitar player, cat lover,
	and tea enthusiast. My favourite loose leaf tea is probably <a

	>, a lovely green tea from Japan.
