<h1>About me</h1>

<p>
	I'm an astronomer and science communicator from the UK. Since completing my undergraduate degree
	in Bath in the UK in 2019, my career has taken me across Europe - doing my PhD in Heidelberg,
	Germany, and since 2025 working as a postdoc at the University of Vienna in Austria.

	My research is mostly about the Milky Way and open clusters, and I have the most fun when I get to
	do 'applied computer science' on otherwise-impossible astronomy tasks. There are a lot of really
	amazing new techniques that have come out within the past few years and decades, and it's fun to
	try applying them to otherwise difficult observational data. You'll catch me writing lots of code
	(including this entire website) and publishing it over on <a
		href="https://github.com/emilyhunt"
		target="_blank">GitHub</a
	>.
</p>

<p>
	I've always thought that effectively communicating science is as important as doing science
	itself. Throughout my PhD, I built a small online following by communicating my science on
	Twitter. When Twitter was effectively ruined for outreach, I turned my attention to building a new
	astronomy community on Bluesky. <a href="https://astrosky.eco/" target="_blank"
		>The Astrosky Ecosystem</a
	> now includes over two thousand astronomers and astronomy organizations, and is working towards becoming
	a permanent home for astronomy outreach and communication online.
</p>

<p>
	I am also fiercely passionate about improving inclusivity & equality in science for all. To quote
	the charity Pride in STEM, “Science does not happen in a vacuum.” The environment in which we
	conduct research can have a profound effect on the wellbeing of minority groups. It is essential
	that science is a welcoming place, so that all minds can flourish and achieve their best.

<p>
	Outside of astronomy, I'm also a sound engineer, guitar player, cat lover, and tea enthusiast. My
	favourite loose leaf tea is probably <a

	>, a lovely green tea from Japan.
