The following post exists to test all markdown functionality of this site.

## Subheading

Hopefully that looks good. Likewise, what about if we make:

* a list
* of multiple
* things?

## Code blocks

This website can support nicely formatted code blocks:

```python
def some_function(x)
    print("Value of x:", x)
    return x * 2
```

## Quotes

It's also possible to embed quotes!

> Reviewer 1 is the new reviewer 2.

Just like that!
