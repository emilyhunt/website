Paper time! [A paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...689A..91S/abstract) led by Dane Sp√§th that I'm a co-author on got published today.

A giant star in the open cluster NGC 4349 has [previously been reported](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007A%26A...472..657L/abstract) to have a low-mass brown dwarf companion. However, [oddities in the long-term radial velocity and photometric trends](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...679A..94D/abstract) of the star made this seem implausible. But nobody had a model to explain it... until now!

We created a model for stellar non-radial oscillations which can be used to explain the odd radial velocity and photometric time series, demonstrating that the brown dwarf candidate is probably just **a 'weird', non-radial oscillation mode** in the star. We also showed that NGC 4349 No. 127 sits in a relatively sparse region of period-luminosity space for giant star planet candidates, suggesting that there could be many more planet candidates around giant stars that are actually also just weird oscillations:
