It's paper day! I'm a co-author on a new paper led by Dr Sebastian Ratzenböck at the University of Vienna. Sebastian used his [SigMA clustering algorithm](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/09/aa43690-22/aa43690-22.html) to analyse the clustering of stars in a box near to the [Sco-Cen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpius%E2%80%93Centaurus_association) association of young stars.

Owing to how sensitive the SigMA algorithm is, we found that this region is full of **a dozen streams of stars** that formed together within the last few hundreds of millions of years. They are long, sparse, and everywhere:

The **number** of streams that Sebastian found is particularly remarkable, because it exceeds estimates from N-body simulations by **one to two orders of magnitude**. More work is needed to investigate more regions, but it seems that these streams of stars are **much more common** than previously thought.

One other particularly exciting thing in the paper is the stream **Theia 368**. It's a stream that's currently passing through the Sco-Cen association and molecular clouds. We found that the passage is **actively tearing the stream apart** - the part of the stream closest to Sco-Cen clearly has a different direction of movement:

As far as I'm aware, this is the **first ever direct observation** of a star cluster being torn apart by a molecular cloud. To explain the relative rarity of old star clusters in the Milky Way's disk, molecular clouds were proposed as a disruption mechanism for star clusters by [Lyman Spitzer in 1958](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1958ApJ...127...17S/abstract). This is [a widely accepted theory](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ARA%26A..57..227K/abstract) for how star clusters are destroyed. However, I don't think that anyone else had ever seen it happening until now!

You can check out the paper [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025A%26A...694A.307R/abstract). There's also a really cool [interactive figure](https://homepage.univie.ac.at/sebastian.ratzenboeck/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/disk_streams_ratzenboeck2024.html) showing the location of the streams.
